# About Config Service

## Project Mission
Provide a robust, centralized configuration management system that eliminates the need for environment-specific code and enables dynamic service updates.

## Key Personas
- **Cloud Native Developer**: Needs to consume configurations reliably and with minimal boilerplate.
- **Platform Engineer**: Manages the lifecycle of configurations across multiple applications.

## Success Criteria
- **Zero-downtime**: Configuration updates must not require service restarts.
- **Observability**: High transparency into when and why configurations change.
- **Type Safety**: Strict validation of configuration schemas.
